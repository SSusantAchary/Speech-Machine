# Speech-Machine

Speech-Machine is an AI-assisted speech practice and review platform for recorded sessions, uploaded videos, transcripts, delivery analytics, and guided reading practice.

## What It Does

- Records practice videos in the browser with camera and microphone selection.
- Uploads existing videos for asynchronous transcription and review.
- Downloads transcript output as `.txt` and `.pdf`.
- Saves full practice sessions with score, transcript, metrics, and review data.
- Restores unsaved recording drafts from browser storage after refresh.
- Tracks realtime speaking cues such as words per minute, filler words, pauses, and rolling captions.
- Tracks delivery signals such as eye contact, smile, loudness, and head movement.
- Supports a scrollable reading document panel during recording for `.pdf` and `.txt` files.
- Highlights the current reading block during recording using live browser speech cues when supported.
- Exports complete session bundles and supports video-only delete or full session delete.
- Supports local-only admin login or normal email/password authentication.

## Core Capabilities

### Recording and review

- Browser-based recording with MediaRecorder
- Realtime preview and review playback
- Draft recovery for unsaved recordings
- Session comparison and score breakdown
- Timeline markers for speaking issues and improvement points

### Speech analysis

- Final server-side transcription
- Realtime browser speech cues where the Web Speech API is available
- Average and realtime WPM
- Filler-word detection
- Long-pause and silence detection
- Transcript search and filler highlighting

### Delivery analysis

- Eye-contact estimation using MediaPipe face landmarks
- Smile and head stability metrics
- Loudness tracking from the audio stream
- Composite scoring across delivery, speech, and content

### Guided reading

- Upload a reading document during recording
- Supported input: `.pdf`, `.txt`
- Vertical teleprompter-style reading panel below the recorder
- Live paragraph highlighting based on current spoken content when browser speech recognition is available

## Platform Compatibility

### Primary supported runtime

The primary supported runtime is the Docker stack.

| Platform | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| macOS | Supported | Best overall local development path with Docker Desktop |
| Linux | Supported | Good fit for local and server deployment |
| Windows | Supported | Use Docker Desktop; WSL2-backed setups are recommended |

### Browser compatibility

| Browser | Recording | Realtime speech cues | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Chrome | Supported | Best support | Recommended browser |
| Edge | Supported | Good support | Recommended browser |
| Safari | Supported | Limited / browser-dependent | Recording path includes Safari-specific handling; Web Speech API support may be unavailable |
| Firefox | Partial | Limited | Core UI works, but speech-recognition behavior depends on browser capabilities |

### Desktop runtime note

The repo also contains a desktop-oriented runtime foundation, but the default and recommended deployment path is still Docker. Optional `MLX Audio` support is macOS Apple Silicon oriented.

## Minimum System Requirements

These are practical minimums for local Docker usage, not hard-enforced limits.

| Requirement | Minimum | Recommended |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CPU | 4 logical cores | 8 logical cores |
| Memory | 8 GB RAM | 16 GB RAM |
| Free disk | 10 GB | 20+ GB, especially when downloading transcription models |
| Browser | Modern Chromium / Safari | Latest Chrome or Edge |
| Camera / Mic | Required for recording mode | External mic recommended for better transcription quality |
| Docker | Docker Desktop or Docker Engine + Compose | Latest stable |

Notes:
- Larger Whisper models need more RAM, disk, and transcription time.
- GPU is optional. CPU-only operation is supported.
- If you plan to keep multiple downloaded models locally, reserve additional disk space.

## Supported Transcription Models

### Docker / server backend

The default backend is the built-in server backend using `faster-whisper==1.1.0`. Models are downloaded only when the user explicitly chooses `Download` in the UI.

- `openai/whisper-tiny`
- `openai/whisper-base`
- `openai/whisper-small`
- `openai/whisper-medium`
- `openai/whisper-large-v3`
- `openai/whisper-large-v3-turbo`

### Optional MLX Audio backend

Available only in the optional desktop-oriented path when `mlx-audio` is installed and the runtime is compatible.

- `mlx-community/whisper-large-v3-turbo-asr-fp16`
- `distil-whisper/distil-large-v3`
- `mlx-community/Qwen3-ASR-1.7B-8bit`
- `mlx-community/Qwen3-ForcedAligner-0.6B-8bit`
- `mlx-community/parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v3`
- `mlx-community/Voxtral-Mini-3B-2507-bf16`
- `mlx-community/Voxtral-Mini-4B-Realtime-2602-4bit`
- `mlx-community/Voxtral-Mini-4B-Realtime-2602-fp16`
- `mlx-community/VibeVoice-ASR-bf16`

## Latency Characteristics

Speech-Machine does not ship a formal benchmark suite yet, so latency depends on browser, host CPU/GPU, selected model, and recording length.

| Workflow | Expected behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Live recorder metrics | Near realtime in the browser |
| Live face / delivery metrics | Near realtime on modern hardware |
| Save session | Usually seconds, depending on file size and storage |
| Final transcription | Seconds to minutes depending on video duration and model size |
| Model download | One-time per model; depends on model size and network speed |

Practical guidance:
- `Whisper Tiny` and `Whisper Base` are the fastest options.
- `Whisper Small` is a good default balance for local CPU usage.
- `Whisper Medium`, `Large v3`, and `Large v3 Turbo` need more memory and longer completion time.
